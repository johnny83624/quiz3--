# Ship Target Tracking Algorithm Based on Adaptive Improvement Unscented Particle Filter

Abstract—Aiming at the impact of limited network transmission bandwidth and strong clutter interference on ship tracking, an adaptive unscented particle filter fusion method combined with adaptive bit quantization technology for ship tracking is studied.First of all, two clusters were performed using information such as the location of the radiation source and carrier frequency to achieve data compression and clutter suppression;Next, apply adaptive bit quantization technology to obtain random quantized observations of each tracking node to the moving ship.The process is modeled by the first-order Markov model with random noise, and the quantization error is used as the component of the system state estimation to establish a target tracking model with unknown variance of part of the process noise component.Finally, using the adaptive unscented particle filter as the basic filter, the Sage-Husa estimator is used to estimate and correct the statistical characteristics of unknown noise in real time, and a centralized multi-sensor fusion method for offshore ship tracking is derived.The simulation results show that the algorithm can effectively improve the fusion estimation accuracy of the quantization filter.

## I.	INTRODUCTION
Ship surveillance is very important in modern information warfare. Major coastal port areas in our country basically use port ship navigation safety monitoring systems based on automatic identification systems(AIS). The main function of the system is to automatically provide information to shore stations, other ships and aircraft through wireless networks, including ship identification, location, course, speed, navigation status and other safety-related information.The AIS-based ship safety monitoring system is composed of a traffic control command center (fusion center), satellites, ships, shore-based radars and AIS base stations, maritime aircraft, and a large number of fishing vessels equipped with small vessel position reporting systems. Therefore, various sensor devices in the system can obtain dynamic information about the navigation of the relevant target ship, and can transmit it to the monitoring center through the wireless network;After the center integrates and processes these information, it can realize real-time monitoring of the navigation status of each ship in the area[1].
